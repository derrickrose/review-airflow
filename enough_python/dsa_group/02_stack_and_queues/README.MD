# Stacks and Queues

## stacks

data structure that support LIFO (Last In First Out)

## queues

FILO (First In Last Out)

## methods

- push() to add element
- pop() to take element
- peek() return the first element without removing it

## time complexity

stacks and queues can be implemented in such a way that all the operations take constant time

| Method | Stack<br/>complexity | Queue<br/>complexity |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| push() | O(1)                 | O(1)                 |
| pop()  | O(1)                 | O(1)                 |
| peek() | O(1)                 | O(1)                 |
| size() | O(1)                 | O(1)                 |
