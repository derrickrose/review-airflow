# PEP-8 recommendation
# split the imports onto separate lines to improve readability

# cannot use - in variable name
## will result as SyntaxError

# tuples are more memory-efficient and faster to iterate over compared to lists

# python keyword lists
import keyword

print(keyword.kwlist)
print(len(keyword.kwlist))
