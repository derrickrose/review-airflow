## Matte Headcare Routines (Low-Risk)

### Morning Routine (5–7 min)
1. **Cleanse gently** with lukewarm water and a mild, fragrance-free cleanser (e.g., CeraVe Foaming Cleanser).
2. **Pat dry** — avoid rubbing to prevent irritation.
3. **Apply matte moisturizer** from the list above for a soft, shine-free finish.
4. **If outdoors**, choose Bee Bald SPF 30 for sun protection.

### Daytime Touch-Ups (1–2 min)
1. **Check for shine** and dab with oil-blotting sheets (Mantl No‑Shine Sheets or generic unscented papers).
2. **Reapply** a pea-sized amount of matte lotion for events or photos.

### Evening Routine (5 min)
1. **Cleanse again** to remove the day's product, sweat, and pollution.
2. **Exfoliate occasionally** (2–3× per week) with a gentle, fragrance-free scrub.
3. **Apply hydrating moisturizer** (matte or standard) to keep scalp skin barrier healthy.

### Weekly Maintenance
- Exfoliate 2–3× weekly.
- After shaving, use matte lotion instead of alcohol-based aftershaves.
- Once a week at night, use a richer, non-matte moisturizer for recovery.
